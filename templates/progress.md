Created by the long-task skill. Path: docs/progress/<yyyy-mm-dd>-<issue>-<slug>.md on the task branch.
Committed with the work; removed in the final commit before merge, its summary moved into the PR body.
This file is the resume point: a session that resumes, compacts or picks the task up on another day reads it first.
Keep it short and factual. No secrets or token values.

## Goal

```text
<Done-when from the issue>. Checks: <command 1> <expected>; <command 2> <expected>. Or stop after <N> turns.

## Done-when checks

<!-- One row per check in the Goal. The claim-verifier re-runs every command in this table, from the worktree root. -->

| # | Check (command) | Expected result | Last result | Commit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `<command>` | <exit 0 / output contains ...> | <not run / PASS / FAIL: line> | <sha> |

## Plan

<!-- State: todo | doing | done | blocked | dropped. Model and tier per step (subagent / Workflow / second session / main). -->

| # | Step | Model | Tier | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | <step> | <opus/sonnet/haiku/fable> | <main/subagent/Workflow/session> | todo |

## Evidence log
